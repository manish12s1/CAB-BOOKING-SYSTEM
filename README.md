# CAB-BOOKING-SYSTEM


 Project RJ One Way Cab Booking System is a comprehensive web-based application developed to 
streamline the intercity cab booking process for users. The primary objective of this system is to facilitate 
one-way ride bookings, providing an efficient alternative to traditional two-way fare cab systems. The 
system allows users to easily log in, select pick-up and drop-off locations, choose ride times, and submit 
ride requests, all from a user-friendly interface. It also enables the admin to manage ride bookings and 
customer data effectively. 
This application is developed using PHP as the backend programming language, with frontend support 
from HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. MySQL is used as the database management system to 
store and retrieve data related to users, bookings, and routes. 
Objectives 
The RJ One Way Cab Booking System can serve a wide range of travel-related purposes and be beneficial 
to individual users, families, and businesses. Key uses of the system include: 
One-WayRideBooking: 
Users can book cabs for a one-way journey between selected cities, helping them avoid unnecessary two
way charges. This is particularly valuable for travelers who do not plan to return to the point of origin 
immediately or want to use alternative means for the return trip. 
Real-TimeBookingInterface: 
The booking interface includes dropdown selections for city locations, date and time pickers for 
scheduling, and validation features that prevent users from selecting invalid or past dates. This ensures 
users experience a smooth and error-free booking process. 
 
 
  
 
RideCancellationSupport: 
A dedicated "Cancel Ride" functionality is provided to allow users to withdraw a booking if their plans 
change. This ensures flexibility and helps the system manage availability better. 
UserandAdminModules: 
The system is designed to be operated by both end-users and administrators. Users can submit and track 
their bookings, while the admin can oversee booking requests, view customer details, and manage cab 
allocations effectively through the backend. 
ScalabilityandExtendability: 
The system is built to support scalability. More city routes, cab types, fare rules, or features such as 
online payments and GPS tracking can be added in future versions. Additionally, separate dashboards 
for customers and admins enhance the overall management. 
ApplicationGoalsandBenefits: 
The aim of the RJ One Way Cab Booking System is to simplify the cab booking process while making 
it cost-effective and reliable. This system empowers users to: 
Book intercity rides with real-time availability and simple UI. 
Avoid paying for return rides when not needed. 
View fare details, booking history, and manage ride requests. 
Connect with the admin for support and service confirmation. 
By focusing on the one-way fare model, the application reduces unnecessary travel costs for users and 
increases vehicle efficiency for service providers. It supports seamless digital communication between 
passengers and service operators while offering transparency and accessibility through a centralized 
platform. 
This project is a step forward in addressing the inefficiencies of conventional cab systems and focuses 
on providing a practical solution tailored to one-way cab needs in India.
